//! The timeline: tracks of clips with a ruler and a playhead.
//!
//! One widget serves three places (see [`Mode`]): the Edit page's timeline, the Cut page's
//! detail timeline (the playhead stays in the middle and the clips move under it) and the
//! Cut page's overview strip (the whole timeline at once).
//!
//! Clips are moved and trimmed by dragging. While a drag is going on only a preview is drawn;
//! the command is run when the pointer is released, so a drag is one undo step and a refused edit
//! (an overlap) changes nothing.
